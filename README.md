AV1 BD Preset V1

After spending 30+ hours post SVT3.1 and countless hours prior, I've managed to create a user preset for Handbrake that retains the original look and detail of BD films while offering storage savings between 2-6x. 

The preset is tested to work with Handbrake 1.10.1

Please note disabling fast decode seems to break the syntax and having it enabled prevents micro-blocking in key-frames (possible bug with HB). 

Preset is easy to use 

Install Handbrake 
Import the Preset (From File)
Load your fav BD titles and convert
